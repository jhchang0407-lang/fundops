"""Industry → Valuation Method Configuration.

Ported from Section_Distributor_2.js INDUSTRY_VALUATION_CONFIG + SKIP_DCF_INDUSTRIES.

Three valuation modes:
  "dcf"             → Standard DCF + peer multiples (tech, consumer, healthcare)
  "financial_peer"  → Banks/Insurance/REITs — EV meaningless, use P/E + P/B
  "industry_peer"   → Commodity/cyclical/regulated — EV valid but FCF unreliable
